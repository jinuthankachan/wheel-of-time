        <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Overview: Text block. Goal: Inform. Method: Static HTML. Interaction: None. Justification: Provides initial context.
        - Story: Nested collapsibles (main plot points as primary, paragraphs/sub-sections as secondary). Goal: Inform, Organize. Method: HTML + JS for toggles. Interaction: Click to expand/collapse. Justification: Manages large narrative text effectively, allows users to focus on parts of the story, and ensures all content is immediately visible upon expansion. All source text included.
        - Characters: Grid of cards opening modals. Goal: Inform, Organize, Detail on demand. Method: HTML + JS for dynamic modal content. Interaction: Click card to open modal. Justification: Presents a scannable list of characters, with details available without cluttering the main view.
        - Places: Grid of cards opening modals. Goal: Inform, Organize, Detail on demand. Method: HTML + JS for dynamic modal content. Interaction: Click card to open modal. Justification: Similar to characters, allows easy browsing of locations.
        - World & Factions: Collapsibles for magical constructs and for cultures/factions. Goal: Inform, Organize. Method: HTML + JS for toggles. Interaction: Click to expand/collapse. Justification: Organizes complex lore into digestible pieces.
        - Prophecies: Text block, key phrases possibly highlighted. Goal: Inform. Method: Static HTML. Interaction: None. Justification: Presents key thematic elements directly.
        - No Chart.js/Plotly.js needed as the source is purely narrative text. Graphics will be Unicode characters for icons.
        - Library/Method: Vanilla JavaScript for all interactions. Tailwind CSS for styling.

                        This interactive summary explores "The Fires of Heaven,"
                        the fifth book in Robert Jordan's epic fantasy series,
                        The Wheel of Time. It is a sprawling narrative that
                        significantly advances several key plotlines, deepens
                        character development, and expands upon the rich
                        tapestry of its world.

                    <p>
                        The story unfolds in a world where time is cyclical,
                        represented by the Wheel of Time, which spins the
                        Pattern of Ages using the lives of individuals as its
                        threads. Certain individuals, known as
                        <em>ta'veren</em>, are focal points in the Pattern,
                        around whom the threads of destiny weave more tightly,
                        influencing the lives of those around them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The driving force of the Wheel is the One Power, drawn
                        from the True Source. This Power is divided into two
                        halves: <em>saidin</em>, the male half, and
                        <em>saidar</em>, the female half. They are different yet
                        complementary. Ages ago, during the War of the Power
                        against the Dark One (Shai'tan), Lews Therin Telamon,
                        the Dragon, and his male channelers, the Hundred
                        Companions, sealed the Dark One's prison. However, the
                        Dark One's counterstroke tainted <em>saidin</em>,
                        causing all male channelers to eventually go mad and
                        die, leading to the Breaking of the World, a cataclysm
                        that reshaped continents and ended the technologically
                        advanced Age of Legends.

                    <p>
                        The current era is the Third Age, an age of prophecy.
                        The primary prophecy concerns the Dragon Reborn, the
                        reincarnation of Lews Therin Telamon, who is destined to
                        fight the Dark One at Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle.
                        This figure is Rand al'Thor. The Forsaken (or "Chosen"
                        as they call themselves) are thirteen of the most
                        powerful channelers from the Age of Legends who swore
                        allegiance to the Dark One. They were sealed in the Bore
                        with their master but are now slowly breaking free.

                        Prophecy is a dominant force in "The Fires of Heaven,"
                        shaping actions, driving characters, and heralding
                        monumental changes. The most significant are the
                        Prophecies of the Dragon, foretelling the Dragon
                        Reborn's coming and his destiny to face the Dark One at
                        Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rand al'Thor's existence as the Dragon Reborn is a
                        constant affirmation of these prophecies. His every
                        major act, from being proclaimed Car'a'carn by the Aiel
                        to his confrontations with the Forsaken, is often viewed
                        through the lens of what was foretold. The prophecies
                        speak of the Dragon Reborn breaking the world again in
                        his bid to save it, a heavy burden that weighs on Rand
                        throughout the narrative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other prophecies also weave through the story, such as
                        those specific to the Aiel or visions seen by characters
                        like Min Farshaw. These foretellings often bring both
                        hope and dread, as characters grapple with the seemingly
                        immutable nature of fate versus their own free will. The
                        prophecies create an atmosphere of inevitability,
                        highlighting the grand scale of the conflict and the
                        pivotal roles individuals are destined to play.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In "The Fires of Heaven," the impact of prophecy is
                        palpable: it fuels the Shaido rebellion against Rand,
                        influences the decisions of the Salidar Aes Sedai, and
                        underscores the sacrifices made by characters like
                        Moiraine Damodred. It is the invisible hand guiding the
                        major currents of the story, pushing the world
                        inexorably towards the Last Battle.

                        "In the heart of the Aiel Waste, within the sun-scorched, ancient city of Rhuidean, Rand al'Thor wrestled with the immense weight of his destiny. The title of Car'a'carn, chief of Aiel chiefs, rested uneasily upon his young shoulders. Each day was a battle against the encroaching whispers of Lews Therin Telamon, the Dragon of a bygone Age, whose memories and madness threatened to consume him. By his side, a shadow in the form of a tutor, the Forsaken Asmodeanâ€”captured, his power partially leashed, and cloaked in the guise of the unassuming gleeman Jasin Nataâ€”imparted forbidden knowledge of the One Power. It was a perilous dance, a desperate pact for survival in a world rapidly descending into chaos.",
                        "The fragile peace of this desert sanctuary was soon shattered. Dire portents arrived on the hot winds: Couladin, a charismatic Shaido chieftain with a false claim to the title of Car'a'carn, had ignited the fury of his clan. A crimson tide of Shaido warriors, swollen with allies, had surged across the towering Spine of the World, a wave of brutal conquest aimed at the unsuspecting \"treekiller\" lands of the west. Their passage was marked by pillage and slaughter, a brutal scar upon the land that demanded a response.",
                        "With a heart heavy with foreboding, Rand gathered the Aiel clans who had sworn him fealty. A formidable host they were, yet their numbers were shadowed by the clans who remained undecided, and the open rebellion of the Shaido. Moiraine Damodred, her sapphire eyes reflecting a grim resolve, and her stoic Warder, Lan Mandragoran, steeled themselves for the arduous campaign ahead. Egwene al'Vere, her innate strength in the One Power blossoming under the stern guidance of the Aiel Wise Onesâ€”Amys, Bair, and Melaineâ€”found herself an integral part of this war party. Aviendha, a Maiden of the Spear, bound by the Wise Ones' decree to remain at Rand's side, to teach him the intricate customs of her people, fought a silent battle with her own burgeoning emotions and conflicting duties. And Mat Cauthon, ever the reluctant hero, his mind a chaotic repository of ancient battles and a gambler's desperate hunches, was once again swept into the maelstrom of a destiny he yearned to escape.",

The harsh, unforgiving landscape bore silent witness to the blossoming of an unexpected and tender love. Rand and Aviendha, thrust together by the capricious whims of the Pattern and the demands of their respective duties, found the initial friction between them slowly yielding to a profound, passionate connection. Despite Aviendha's fierce independence, her deeply ingrained loyalty to Elayneâ€”whom she considered a near-sister after their shared visions in Rhuideanâ€”and the vast cultural chasm that separated their worlds, their hearts became irrevocably intertwined. Their love was a fragile, precious bloom in a world teetering on the precipice of darkness, yet it became a source of intense internal conflict for the young Maiden, torn between desire and honor.",

The spectral memories of long-dead generals whispered strategies in his mind, his ashandarei felt like a natural extension of his soul, and his uncanny luck, as always, defied all logic and probability. His path, however, was not without its own shadows. He found himself entangled with Melindhra, a Shaido Maiden whose dark, knowing eyes held secrets. She was a viper in their midst, a covert agent of the Forsaken Sammael, her presence a subtle, insidious poison seeping into the heart of Rand's camp.",

                        "Far from the searing heat of the Aiel pursuit, in the ostensibly more civilized lands of the west, Nynaeve al'Meara and Elayne Trakand embarked on their own perilous odyssey. Guarded by the worldly wisdom of Thom Merrilin and the steadfast loyalty of Juilin Sandar, they set forth from the city of Tanchico, their initial destination the distant, legendary White Tower of Tar Valon. But the world they had known was rapidly unraveling. News, sharp as a shard of glass, reached them: Siuan Sanche, the Amyrlin Seat, the very bedrock of Aes Sedai authority, had been overthrown in a brutal coup, her connection to the True Source savagely severed. Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan, a formidable and ambitious sister of the Red Ajah, had seized the Amyrlin's stole, and the White Tower, for millennia a beacon of unity and strength, now stood fractured, a house divided against itself. This calamitous revelation shattered their plans and cast them adrift in a sea of uncertainty. Hunted by Elaida's implacable agents and stalked by the insidious Forsaken Moghedien, known as the Spider for her mastery of shadowy intrigue, Nynaeve and Elayne were driven into the clandestine world of fugitives. Their journey became a desperate flight, compelling them to seek refuge in the unlikeliest of sanctuaries: Valan Luca's garish, boisterous travelling menagerie. Under the guise of performers, they navigated the treacherous roads of Ghealdan and Amadicia, Nynaeve wrestling with the frustrating mental block that only allowed her to channel the One Power when consumed by rage, while Elayne, with quiet focus and determination, diligently honed her considerable skills, her rare and precious talent for the creation of ter'angreal proving to be an invaluable asset.",
                        "The ethereal, shifting landscape of Tel'aran'rhiod, the World of Dreams, became their clandestine meeting place. Through the shimmering, insubstantial gateways of ter'angreal, Nynaeve and Elayne conferred with Egwene and the Aiel Wise Ones, sharing vital news and whispered anxieties across impossible, dream-forged distances. Yet, this hidden realm was not their exclusive sanctuary. Moghedien, a consummate master of its fluid realities, hunted them there with chilling persistence. In a terrifying, dream-woven confrontation, the Forsaken's venomous malice struck not only at Nynaeve but also at Birgitte Silverbow, a legendary archer and one of the revered Heroes of the Horn, whose spirit awaited rebirth within the dream world. With an act of cruel, devastating power, Moghedien ripped Birgitte from the fabric of Tel'aran'rhiod, casting her, grievously wounded and life-force fading, into the harsh, unforgiving reality of the waking world. In a desperate, instinctive act of preservation, Elayne forged an unprecedented bond, making Birgitte her Warderâ€”an act unheard of, a bond of necessity and compassion forged by one not yet a full Aes Sedai. Birgitte, snatched from the mists of legend into a fragile mortal coil, survived, her destiny now inextricably, profoundly linked with the Daughter-Heir of Andor, their shared ordeal forging a deep and resilient companionship.",
                        "While some sought the shadows of refuge, others actively fanned the embers of rebellion. Siuan Sanche, stripped of her title and her connection to the Source but not of her formidable will and razor-sharp intellect, journeyed onward. With her traveled Leane Sharif, her former Keeper, also stilled and grappling with a startlingly flamboyant new persona, and the clear-eyed Min Farshaw, whose cryptic visions painted tantalizing, often unsettling, pictures of the future. Their arduous quest led them to the unassuming, almost forgotten village of Salidar, nestled in the hinterlands of Altara. Here, a hidden enclave of Aes Sedai, those who defied Elaida's tyrannical rule and the fracturing of the Tower, had gathered in secret. Though stilled, Siuan's mind remained a potent weapon of political maneuvering. With carefully chosen words and shrewd, insightful calculations, she began to weave the disparate threads of dissent into a cohesive, purposeful force, subtly guiding the Salidar Aes Sedai, led by the wary Sheriam Bayanar and a council of equally cautious Sitters, to declare themselves the true heart of the White Tower and to acknowledge the urgent, undeniable need to find and guide the Dragon Reborn. Into this volatile crucible of rebellion strode Gareth Bryne, the former Captain-General of Andor's Queen's Guard, a man of unyielding honor and legendary military prowess. He had tracked Siuan across kingdoms, initially to hold her to an oath extracted under duress, but soon found himself drawn into the Aes Sedai's desperate cause, agreeing to raise an army for this nascent, defiant rebellion.",

                        "The smoldering embers of conflict finally erupted into a raging inferno around the beleaguered city of Cairhien. Rand's Aiel, a storm of flashing spears and chilling battle cries, crashed against the Shaido hordes that had laid siege to the city's proud walls. The battles that followed were a maelstrom of unimaginable carnage and breathtaking courage, the fate of a nation hanging precariously in the balance. Mat Cauthon, despite every ingrained instinct to remain a mere observer, to avoid the crushing weight of command, found himself thrust into the very heart of the conflict. The ancient, spectral memories surged within him, transforming the reluctant gambler into an instinctive, brilliant commander. He rallied the demoralized Tairen and Cairhienin soldiers, his unconventional tactics and uncanny luck snatching improbable victories from the very jaws of defeat. In a brutal, desperate duel that would decide the fate of thousands, Mat faced Couladin, the charismatic, false Car'a'carn. With a final, decisive blow, born of skill and a touch of the Pattern's favor, Mat ended the Shaido leader's reign of terror, shattering his army's will to fight and scattering them to the winds. Yet, even in the heady rush of victory, the Shadow's chilling touch was keenly felt. From his distant, shadowed throne in Illian, the Forsaken Sammael unleashed a torrent of the One Power, a devastating, unseen attack that obliterated the tower from which Rand had been directing his forces. Rand survived, shielded by the Pattern or perhaps by sheer chance, but the assault was a stark, chilling reminder of the ever-present, insidious threat posed by the Forsaken. The crown of Cairhien, a glittering symbol of his hard-won, bloody victory, was offered to him. But Rand, wary of such trappings of power, refused it, choosing instead to become the city's protector, his influence spreading beyond the Aiel, drawing \"wetlanders\" to his banner, his legend growing with each passing day.",

                        "Dark tidings, like carrion birds, traveled on the wind, reaching Rand amidst the fragile peace of a newly liberated Cairhien. Word arrived that Queen Morgase Trakand of Andor, Elayne's mother and a cornerstone of Westland stability, was presumed dead, her throne usurped by the shadowy, manipulative Lord Gaebril. This Gaebril was none other than the Forsaken Rahvin, his insidious, mind-twisting Compulsion having ensnared the Queen and twisted her will to his own. In truth, Morgase, with a desperate courage she did not know what she possessed, had narrowly escaped the gilded cage of Caemlyn. A fugitive in her own land, she journeyed towards the uncertain sanctuary of Amadicia, heartbreakingly oblivious to her tormentor's true, monstrous identity. Rand, already burdened by the crushing weight of a world's salvation, felt a fresh, agonizing surge of guilt and incandescent fury, believing he had failed to protect Andor, failed to shield Elayne's mother from the Shadow's grasp.",
                        "Before he could turn his righteous wrath upon Rahvin, another of the Forsaken, driven by motives far more personal and twisted, unleashed her power. Lanfear, her breathtaking beauty a deceptive mask for an obsessive, possessive love for Lews Therin's reincarnation, her mind poisoned by a venomous jealousy of Rand's burgeoning bond with Aviendha, attacked them in Cairhien. Her fury was a tempest of the One Power, beautiful and deadly. But Moiraine Damodred, her every action, every sacrifice, guided by an unshakeable, almost fanatical resolve to see the Dragon Reborn fulfill his prophesied destiny, had foreseen this terrible confrontation in the swirling visions of a Rhuidean ter'angreal. In an act of ultimate, selfless sacrifice, the Aes Sedai threw herself at Lanfear. The two powerful channelers, Light and Shadow locked in a desperate, final struggle, plunged through the shimmering, unstable redstone doorway ter'angrealâ€”the gateway to the enigmatic, perilous realm of the Aelfinn and Eelfinn. The portal flared with an unnatural light, then buckled and melted into incandescent slag, sealing their fate. Moiraine and Lanfear were gone, consumed by the mysteries that lay beyond the melted stone. Lan's Warder bond, a lifeline of shared existence, a connection deeper than blood, shattered with Moiraine's apparent demise. As per her meticulous, secret arrangements, born of a profound understanding of a Warder's grief, the bond flowed not into the agonizing oblivion of severance but to Myrelle Berengari, another Aes Sedai. It was a desperate, compassionate measure to spare Lan the soul-crushing agony that would have otherwise undoubtedly claimed him. Rand, who had so often chafed under Moiraine's cryptic guidance, who had railed against her perceived manipulations, was left utterly devastated, the true depth of her unwavering sacrifice and the profound wisdom he had so often spurned finally, heartbreakingly, laid bare.",

In the blink of an eye, he transported himself and a handpicked force of his most loyal Aiel warriorsâ€”the Maidens of the Spear, fierce and unyieldingâ€”across the vast distances to the royal city of Caemlyn. But Rahvin, a master of deceit and illusion, a spider in his web of power, was waiting. The very skies above the Andoran capital wept tears of lightning, and the air crackled with a malevolent, palpable energy. In the ensuing chaos of Rahvin's meticulously laid and deadly trap, Mat Cauthon, Aviendha, and even the Forsaken Asmodean were struck down, their lives seemingly extinguished by the Forsaken's devastating, indiscriminate attacks.",

Their cataclysmic duel, a tempest of raw Power and desperate fury, transcended the confines of the physical realm, spilling over into the treacherous, dreamlike landscape of Tel'aran'rhiod. There, in that world of shifting realities and malleable truths, an unexpected and crucial ally emerged. Nynaeve al'Meara, who, with the invaluable aid of Birgitte Silverbow, had ingeniously ensnared the elusive Moghedien in the World of Dreams using a Seanchan a'dam, learned of Rand's desperate, life-or-death struggle. Fearless, her spirit ablaze with righteous fury, she plunged into the dream-reflection of Caemlyn. Her sudden, electrifying appearance, a flash of pure, unadulterated anger and protective loyalty, momentarily distracted the powerful Rahvin. In that critical, fleeting instant, Rand gathered the full, terrible might of saidin, the male half of the One Power, and unleashed a torrent of balefireâ€”a forbidden, terrifying weave that not only killed its victim but also burned their thread from the Pattern backward in time, erasing their most recent actions from existence. Rahvin, caught in the searing, incandescent stream of pure destruction, was annihilated, his very being unraveled from the threads of time, his dark reign brought to an abrupt and absolute end.",

In the waking world, within the ravaged palace of Caemlyn, Mat Cauthon, Aviendha, and Asmodean stirred, gasping for breath, their "deaths" undone, their lives miraculously restored as if the Forsaken\'s lightning had never found its mark. Victory, however, was a fragile, blood-soaked thing, and it was soon tainted with fresh, chilling tragedy. In the quiet, stunned aftermath, as Caemlyn lay bruised and battered under Rand\'s uncertain control, Asmodean, the reluctant teacher, the Forsaken bound by shield and oath to Rand\'s will, wandered into the shadowed depths of the palace. A figure, cloaked in obscurity, met him there. "You are no longer shielded, are you?" a voice whispered, devoid of warmth, cold and final as the grave. "And you are not him." A flash of unseen violence, a life extinguished in the shadows, and Asmodean fell, his second, true death leaving Rand once more without a guide in the perilous, labyrinthine currents of the One Power. The identity of his killer remained a chilling, unanswered enigma, a whisper of future betrayals.',

Exhausted, travel-worn, but unbowed, they brought their news of triumphs and terrors, of captured Forsaken and battles won against impossible odds, to the council of rebel Aes Sedai. They were received with a mixture of wary suspicion, cautious hope, and a dawning understanding of the monumental stakes at play. In the hidden, ethereal corners of Tel'aran'rhiod, Nynaeve still held the invisible leash of the a'dam, Moghedien her unwilling, seething captiveâ€”a powerful, dangerous weapon in the escalating struggles yet to come. The world had been irrevocably scarred, the Pattern itself strained and rewoven by the fires of heaven, but the Wheel, indifferent to the suffering of mortals, continued its inexorable turn, weaving new destinies from the ashes of the old.",
