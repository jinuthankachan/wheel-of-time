                <h2>Welcome to The Great Hunt</h2>
                <p>
                    *The Great Hunt*, published in 1990, is the second volume in
                    Robert Jordan's monumental *Wheel of Time* series, following
                    *The Eye of the World*. It significantly expands the
                    narrative scope, thematic depth, and world-building
                    introduced in the first book, thrusting its young, reluctant
                    heroes deeper into a sprawling world teetering on the brink
                    of a prophesied Last Battle against the Dark One. The novel
                    is characterized by its accelerating pace, the introduction
                    of new cultures and formidable adversaries (most notably the
                    Seanchan), and the increasing fulfillment of ancient
                    prophecies, particularly those concerning the Dragon Reborn.
                    This application aims to make the rich details of the
                    book—its intricate plot, key character developments, the
                    expansion of its fantastical world, and the crucial role of
                    prophecy in shaping its events—easily consumable and
                    explorable.

                                The narrative commences in Fal Dara, a northern
                                fortress city in Shienar, immediately following
                                the climactic events of *The Eye of the World*.
                                Here, Rand al'Thor, still grappling with his
                                emerging abilities, receives sword training from
                                Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine's stoic Warder.
                                Concurrently, Mat Cauthon's condition worsens, a
                                grim consequence of his psychic attachment to
                                the parasitic dagger he acquired from the cursed
                                city of Shadar Logoth. This deepening affliction
                                is not merely a personal ailment; it serves as a
                                potent symbol of the Shadow's insidious and
                                lingering corruption. The dagger's parasitic
                                nature and Padan Fain's later binding with the
                                malignant entity Mordeth emphasize that the
                                Shadow's influence extends beyond overt attacks
                                by Trollocs and Myrddraal, capable of corrupting
                                from within and affecting the very souls of
                                individuals. Padan Fain, the sinister Darkfriend
                                and peddler, remains imprisoned within the
                                fortress, a constant, unsettling presence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A momentous arrival shakes the fortress: Siuan
                                Sanche, the Amyrlin Seat and leader of the Aes
                                Sedai, descends upon Fal Dara. Her purpose is
                                clear: she formally identifies Rand al'Thor as
                                the Dragon Reborn, the prophesied figure
                                destined to confront the Dark One. Private
                                conversations between Siuan and Moiraine reveal
                                a long-standing friendship and a secret,
                                intricate plan concerning Rand's destiny. The
                                Amyrlin's direct confirmation of Rand as the
                                Dragon Reborn is a declarative statement of his
                                inescapable fate.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, peace is short-lived. A Trolloc and
                                Myrddraal attack breaches the fortress, a
                                shocking display of the Shadow's reach. Amidst
                                the chaos, Padan Fain is freed by Darkforces,
                                and in a brazen act of defiance, he steals the
                                legendary Horn of Valere—an artifact capable of
                                summoning dead heroes—along with Mat's tainted
                                dagger. This audacious theft acts as the primary
                                catalyst, compelling Rand and his companions
                                into a proactive "hunt" rather than allowing
                                Rand to continue his desperate attempts to
                                escape his destiny. A chilling message, scrawled
                                in blood on the dungeon walls, is left for Rand:
                                the Dark Lord is not dead and awaits him on
                                Toman Head. This explicitly links these initial
                                events to the book's ultimate destination,
                                establishing a clear, almost predetermined
                                narrative trajectory for Rand, highlighting the
                                theme of destiny's inescapable grip.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With the Horn and dagger stolen, the main
                                characters diverge. Rand, accompanied by Perrin
                                Aybara, Mat Cauthon, the Ogier Loial, and the
                                unique "sniffer" Hurin, joins a Shienaran party
                                led by Lord Ingtar Shinowa. Their mission is to
                                pursue Fain and retrieve the stolen artifacts,
                                heading southbound. Hurin's extraordinary
                                ability to "smell" past violence, literally
                                tracking the lingering scent of past evil,
                                proves invaluable in tracking the Darkfriends.
                                Perrin, meanwhile, secretly employs his
                                burgeoning wolfbrother ability, communicating
                                telepathically with wolves to aid in the
                                tracking. This power is not merely a convenient
                                plot device; it foreshadows a central internal
                                conflict for Perrin throughout the series: his
                                struggle to reconcile his human identity with
                                his growing connection to wolves and the wild.
                                His initial reluctance and mistrust of this
                                power, even as it proves useful, hints at the
                                challenges he will face in balancing his dual
                                nature, making his personal journey distinct and
                                compelling.

                                Concurrently, the Amyrlin Seat departs for Tar
                                Valon, taking Nynaeve al'Meara and Egwene
                                al'Vere with her for formal Aes Sedai training
                                at the White Tower. This immediate bifurcation
                                of the main characters into two distinct
                                plotlines—Rand's physical hunt and the women's
                                magical training—is a crucial structural
                                decision by Robert Jordan, allowing for a
                                significant expansion of the world, developing
                                different geographical regions and societal
                                facets simultaneously. Moiraine Damodred, ever
                                the enigmatic strategist, breaks off from the
                                group unbidden, embarking on her own quest for
                                answers. In Tar Valon, Nynaeve and Egwene
                                quickly befriend Elayne Trakand, the
                                Daughter-Heir of Andor, and the clairvoyant Min
                                Farshaw. Nynaeve, known for her fierce temper
                                and powerful channeling, successfully passes the
                                rigorous test to become Accepted, a rank in the
                                White Tower below Aes Sedai and above Novice.
                                This test involves facing a series of visions,
                                including one of her marrying Lan, which she
                                must ignore to succeed. This period of training
                                and the challenges faced by the women enable
                                deeper, more focused character development for
                                each group, emphasizing that the "Great Hunt" is
                                not merely a chase for a physical object, but
                                also a profound journey of self-discovery,
                                mastery of emerging powers, and understanding
                                their individual roles in the unfolding Pattern.
                                This separation then sets the stage for a more
                                impactful convergence in the climax.

                                During their pursuit of Fain, Rand, Loial, and
                                Hurin experience a bizarre and unsettling event.
                                They fall asleep near a mysterious stone, only
                                to wake up separated from Ingtar's party and
                                transported to an alternative world. This "if
                                world" is a distorted, deserted reflection of
                                their own, where the very landscape seems
                                warped. Rand suspects he unconsciously channeled
                                *saidin*, the male half of the One Power, to
                                activate the Portal Stone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Portal Stones are ancient *ter'angreal*
                                (power-wrought items) predating the Age of
                                Legends, capable of facilitating transportation
                                between other Portal Stones in their own world
                                and even across various "if worlds" or "worlds
                                that might be". These stones bear cryptic
                                symbols representing different realities. The
                                accidental journey through this Portal Stone has
                                a profound effect: while only hours pass for the
                                travelers, four months elapse in their original
                                world, and they experience disturbing visions of
                                possible futures. This particular "if world" is
                                revealed to be one where the legendary Artur
                                Hawkwing lost a critical battle against the
                                Shadow, leading to humanity's annihilation and
                                the Shadow's creatures turning upon themselves.
                                The introduction of Portal Stones and the "if
                                worlds" represents a monumental expansion of the
                                *Wheel of Time*'s cosmology, moving beyond a
                                single reality to encompass a multiverse where
                                "From Stone to Stone run the lines of 'if,'
                                between the worlds that might be". This concept
                                not only adds a layer of cosmic grandeur but
                                also introduces profound philosophical questions
                                about determinism versus free will. The visions
                                of "possible futures" experienced during the
                                extended Portal Stone journey reinforce the idea
                                of a predetermined yet mutable "Pattern" that
                                weaves all lives, challenging the characters and
                                readers to consider the consequences of choices
                                across countless realities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this eerie, desolate reality, Rand encounters
                                a beautiful, enigmatic woman named Selene. She
                                is fighting off a strange creature called a
                                *grolm*. Selene claims to be from Cairhien and
                                appears to be of noble or even royal lineage.
                                She helps Rand and his companions find another
                                Portal Stone, guiding them back to their own
                                world. However, her true identity is far more
                                sinister: she is later revealed to be Lanfear,
                                one of the most powerful of the Forsaken,
                                ancient servants of the Dark One who were
                                imprisoned for millennia. Lanfear had been in
                                love with Lews Therin Telamon, Rand's previous
                                incarnation, and attempts to subtly influence
                                him. Selene's appearance and her later
                                revelation as Lanfear are a critical plot twist
                                and a significant character introduction. Her
                                seemingly helpful demeanor and claims of royalty
                                are a calculated deception. Her true identity as
                                a powerful Forsaken who was intimately connected
                                to Lews Therin immediately establishes a deep,
                                personal, and psychological threat to Rand.
                                Lanfear's attempts to compel or subtly influence
                                Rand highlight the insidious nature of the
                                Forsaken's methods, which extend beyond brute
                                force to manipulation and temptation,
                                foreshadowing the complex psychological warfare
                                Rand will face throughout the series.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rand's party, now reunited with Loial and Hurin,
                                journeys to Cairhien, a nation renowned for its
                                intricate political "Game of Houses". Here, Rand
                                has an unexpected and welcome reunion with Thom
                                Merrilin, the gleeman he believed dead after the
                                events of *The Eye of the World*. However, the
                                respite is brief. Rand and Loial are attacked by
                                Trollocs, and during their escape, the Horn of
                                Valere and Mat's dagger are stolen once more.
                                The repeated theft of the Horn and dagger and
                                the tragic murder of Dena are crucial plot
                                points that underscore the escalating stakes and
                                the relentless, personal nature of the Shadow's
                                pursuit. The personal cost of Rand's presence is
                                tragically underscored when Thom's apprentice,
                                Dena, is murdered for Thom's association with
                                Rand. This highlights the pervasive reach of the
                                Darkfriend network and, more significantly, the
                                growing malevolence and independent agenda of
                                Padan Fain. Fain's transformation into an entity
                                hostile to both Light and Shadow makes him a
                                unique and unpredictable force, adding a new
                                layer of complexity to the overall conflict. His
                                personal obsession with Rand ensures that the
                                pursuit is not merely strategic but deeply
                                personal and vindictive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ingtar's group, having continued their pursuit,
                                arrives in Cairhien and reunites with Rand's
                                party. Hurin's unique tracking ability allows
                                them to trace the Darkfriends to Barthanes
                                Damodred's manor. Using a now-valuable
                                invitation from Barthanes, the trail is followed
                                further to a Waygate on the premises. However,
                                their attempt to use the Waygate is thwarted by
                                the presence of Machin Shin, the malevolent
                                "Black Wind" that corrupts the Ways. The
                                encounter with Machin Shin in the Ways is a
                                significant world-building detail, vividly
                                illustrating the pervasive corruption of the
                                Ways, which were once safe travel networks
                                created by the Ogier. This reinforces the idea
                                that the Shadow's influence is not confined to
                                specific creatures or individuals but can taint
                                even ancient, powerful constructs. This forced
                                reliance on other, riskier travel methods like
                                Portal Stones further emphasizes the world's
                                broken state and the increasing peril faced by
                                the protagonists. Through Barthanes, Padan Fain
                                sends a defiant message: he is taking the Horn
                                to the port city of Falme, on Toman Head.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The narrative shifts to Falme, a port city on
                                Toman Head, now under the brutal occupation of
                                the invading Seanchan Empire and their exotic
                                beasts. Simultaneously, Geofram Bornhald, leader
                                of the zealous Children of the Light
                                (Whitecloaks), prepares his forces to attack the
                                Seanchan, creating a dangerous three-way
                                conflict. The Seanchan invasion is a pivotal
                                development, introducing a formidable new
                                antagonist with a distinct and horrifying
                                culture.

                                In Tar Valon, the treacherous Aes Sedai Liandrin
                                Guirale, secretly a Darkfriend and member of the
                                Black Ajah, lures Egwene, Nynaeve, Elayne, and
                                Min to Toman Head. She deceives them by claiming
                                Rand is in trouble, then cruelly betrays them,
                                handing them over to the Seanchan High Lady
                                Suroth to be enslaved. Liandrin's explicit
                                betrayal is a major plot twist, providing
                                concrete evidence of the Black Ajah's existence
                                within the White Tower, confirming a long-feared
                                rumor and exposing a significant internal threat
                                to the forces of Light. This revelation shatters
                                trust among supposed allies and complicates the
                                fight against the Shadow, demonstrating that the
                                enemy is not solely external but deeply
                                insidious and pervasive, forcing the
                                protagonists to question whom they can truly
                                rely on.

                                Egwene suffers the most horrifying fate: she is
                                collared with an *a'dam*, a terrifying device
                                used by the Seanchan to control channelers,
                                while Min is held hostage. The *a'dam* is a
                                collar linked by a literal leash to a bracelet
                                worn by a *sul'dam* ("Leash Holder"). This
                                device grants the *sul'dam* total control over
                                the *damane* ("Leashed One"), enabling them to
                                compel channeling and inflict excruciating pain
                                for disobedience. This horrifying practice is
                                central to Seanchan society and their military
                                might, as they view *damane* as "weaponized
                                channelers" or "guns". What is secretly known
                                only to a few Seanchan is that *sul'dam*
                                themselves are women who can learn to channel,
                                yet they are trained to believe they cannot,
                                reinforcing the societal structure. Egwene's
                                traumatic experience as a *damane* is a
                                powerful, personal illustration of this cultural
                                clash, serving as a crucible for her character
                                development and shaping her future views on
                                power and freedom.

                                Despite the overwhelming odds, Nynaeve and
                                Elayne manage to escape capture. Driven by
                                fierce loyalty, they embark on a desperate
                                rescue mission, eventually succeeding in freeing
                                Egwene from her torment.

                                The various narrative threads converge
                                dramatically in Falme. Rand's group, the
                                Seanchan forces, and the Whitecloaks clash in a
                                chaotic, multi-sided battle. During the
                                fighting, Lord Ingtar Shinowa makes a shocking
                                confession: he reveals himself to be a
                                Darkfriend, having sworn allegiance to the
                                Shadow out of despair for his people. However,
                                in a final act of redemption, he sacrifices
                                himself fighting bravely against the Seanchan.
                                Ingtar's revelation as a Darkfriend and his
                                subsequent heroic death introduces a significant
                                moral complexity to the narrative. It challenges
                                the simplistic binary of good versus evil,
                                demonstrating that individuals can be driven to
                                the Shadow by despair or perceived necessity,
                                and that even those who have fallen can find a
                                path to redemption through sacrifice. This adds
                                profound nuance to the Light vs. Shadow
                                conflict, suggesting that the struggle is not
                                just external but also internal, and that hope
                                for redemption exists even in the darkest
                                corners.

                                Rand confronts High Lord Turak, the Seanchan
                                commander, in single combat. Rand ultimately
                                slays Turak, successfully retrieving the Horn of
                                Valere and Mat's dagger. Trapped between the
                                advancing Seanchan and Whitecloak lines, Mat
                                Cauthon, despite his illness, makes a fateful
                                decision: he blows the Horn of Valere. The
                                Horn's call summons legendary heroes from the
                                dead, including the mythical Artur Hawkwing, who
                                ride to battle against the Seanchan, turning the
                                tide of the conflict. The banner of the Dragon
                                Reborn is unfurled, a powerful symbol of Rand's
                                emerging destiny.

                                In the midst of the chaos, Ba'alzamon, the
                                figure Rand has encountered in his dreams,
                                appears. He and Rand engage in a climactic duel,
                                which is magically projected into the air above
                                Falme for all to witness. Rand allows himself to
                                be stabbed by Ba'alzamon's staff, creating an
                                opening to plunge his heron-mark sword through
                                Ba'alzamon's heart. Rand's climactic duel with
                                Ba'alzamon is a pivotal moment that showcases
                                Rand's rapidly growing power and his direct
                                confrontation with the supposed embodiment of
                                the Dark One. While later books clarify that
                                Ba'alzamon is actually Ishamael, one of the
                                Forsaken, his portrayal in *The Great Hunt* as
                                the "Dark Lord" in Rand's dreams and his
                                physical manifestation at Falme serve to
                                establish him as the primary antagonist of this
                                early stage. The projection of their fight
                                across the sky is a symbolic proclamation of
                                Rand's power to the world, even if he does not
                                fully grasp the implications or the true
                                identity of his foe at this point. This
                                deception highlights the cunning nature of the
                                Shadow.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With the battle over and the Seanchan forces
                                defeated (for now), Rand is found by Min. As he
                                recuperates, Selene appears, touches the
                                sleeping Rand, and definitively reveals her true
                                identity as the Forsaken Lanfear before
                                vanishing. When Rand awakens, he finds Ingtar's
                                surviving army gathered under the Dragon's
                                banner, offering their pledge of allegiance to
                                him. This public display and the events of Falme
                                force Rand to finally admit and accept his
                                destiny as the Dragon Reborn. The battle at
                                Falme directly fulfills the prophecy: "Five ride
                                forth, and four return. Above the watchers shall
                                he proclaim himself, bannered cross the sky in
                                fire...". This is the undeniable climax of *The
                                Great Hunt*, serving as the dramatic convergence
                                point for all major plotlines and characters,
                                forcing Rand to confront his destiny head-on.
                                This public manifestation of Rand's identity as
                                the Dragon Reborn is a powerful narrative beat,
                                solidifying his unwilling acceptance of his role
                                and marking a definitive, irreversible turning
                                point for his character and the series. It
                                underscores the idea that the Pattern is
                                weaving, and Rand's destiny is unfolding in
                                plain sight.

                                <strong>Fal Dara:</strong> Located in Shienar,
                                Fal Dara is the northernmost city in this
                                nation. It serves as a military fortress,
                                guarding against incursions from the Blight. The
                                book opens here, establishing a sense of
                                immediate danger and the constant vigilance
                                required against the Shadow's forces. Its
                                strategic importance as a frontier outpost is
                                evident in the Trolloc attack that breaches its
                                walls.

                                <strong>Tar Valon:</strong> A major city-state
                                and the seat of the Aes Sedai's White Tower, Tar
                                Valon is a central hub of power, knowledge, and
                                political intrigue. The White Tower itself is a
                                towering structure, symbolizing the Aes Sedai's
                                influence and their role as guardians of the One
                                Power. It serves as the training ground for
                                female channelers, where novices undergo
                                rigorous instruction and tests to become
                                Accepted and then full Aes Sedai. The city's
                                bustling streets, filled with people from
                                diverse lands, highlight its importance as a
                                crossroads of cultures and information.

                                east-central Westlands, Cairhien is renowned for
                                its intricate political system known as the
                                "Game of Houses". This game of subtle
                                maneuvering and social etiquette dictates much
                                of Cairhienin noble society, where even minor
                                gaffes can have significant consequences. The
                                city itself is characterized by its dark and
                                somber fashion. Rand's experiences here expose
                                him to the complexities of high-level politics
                                and the dangers of a society driven by status
                                and hidden agendas.

                                point of the Seanchan invasion. Its occupation
                                by the Seanchan marks a significant shift in the
                                world's geopolitical landscape, introducing a
                                new, terrifying imperial power to the Westlands.
                                The city's strategic coastal location makes it
                                ideal for a naval invasion.

                                *ter'angreal* are remnants from an age before
                                the Age of Legends, designed to facilitate
                                transportation between different locations
                                within the same world and even across various
                                "if worlds" or "worlds that might be". They are
                                described as stone cylinders bearing cryptic
                                symbols, each representing a different reality.
                                The accidental activation of a Portal Stone by
                                Rand transports him, Loial, and Hurin to a
                                distorted parallel world, where time flows
                                differently and humanity has been annihilated.
                                The introduction of these artifacts profoundly
                                expands the cosmology of the *Wheel of Time*,
                                suggesting a multiverse where countless
                                variations of reality exist. This concept
                                introduces deep philosophical questions about
                                determinism versus free will, as characters
                                witness visions of possible futures during their
                                journeys through these "if worlds".

                                after the Breaking of the World, the Ways are a
                                series of paths through an alternate dimension,
                                intended to connect Ogier communities and
                                facilitate quick travel. Stone doorways called
                                Waygates serve as entry points. However, the
                                Ways have been corrupted by Machin Shin, the

                                travelers. This corruption renders the Ways
                                largely unusable and dangerous, forcing
                                protagonists to seek alternative, riskier travel
                                methods like Portal Stones, thereby emphasizing

                                of the Shadow's influence, which can taint even

                                <strong>Seanchan Culture:</strong> The Seanchan
                                are a vast and powerful empire from a continent
                                across the Aryth Ocean, claiming descent from
                                Artur Hawkwing's armies. Their culture is highly
                                disciplined, based around rigid rank and
                                conquest, with a unified government. A central
                                and horrifying aspect of their society is the
                                enslavement of women who can channel the One
                                Power, known as *damane* ("Leashed Ones"). These
                                *damane* are controlled by *sul'dam* ("Leash
                                Holders") using an *a'dam*, a *ter'angreal*
                                consisting of a collar and bracelet linked by a
                                leash. *Sul'dam* are secretly women who can
                                learn to channel, though they are taught they
                                cannot, reinforcing the social hierarchy. The
                                *damane* are treated as "weaponized channelers"
                                or "guns" and are used extensively in their
                                military campaigns. The Seanchan also employ
                                exotic beasts in warfare, such as *raken*
                                (large, dragon-like flying creatures used for
                                transport) and *grolm* (three-eyed frog
                                creatures). Their arrival introduces a profound
                                cultural and ideological conflict, particularly
                                concerning the use and treatment of the One
                                Power, challenging the established norms of the
                                Westlands.

                                Westlands. However, they face increasing

                                This line links Rand to the titles "Lord of the
                                Morning" and "Prince of the Dawn," and is
                                reflected in the Aiel calling him "He Who Comes
                                With The Dawn." It signifies his role in ending
                                one age and inaugurating another, a process that
                                involves both destruction and creation. The
                                breaking of the world refers not only to
                                physical changes but also the shattering of old
                                nations and alliances, and the lives people had
                                made for themselves, as Rand attempts to unite
                                humanity.

                                widespread chaos, the tearing apart of nations,
                                and the release of the Forsaken. It highlights
                                Rand's ultimate sacrifice, with his blood being
                                shed at Shayol Ghul to free humanity from the

                                This prophecy is directly fulfilled at the
                                climax in Falme. Rand, Mat, Perrin, Hurin, and
                                Ingtar ride into the city, but Ingtar, revealing
                                himself as a Darkfriend, dies in a redemptive
                                act, leaving only four to return. Rand's duel
                                with Ba'alzamon, projected across the sky,
                                serves as his public proclamation as the Dragon
                                Reborn, with his banner unfurling in the air.
                                This event is a crucial turning point, forcing
                                Rand to accept his destiny.

                                Cairhien and Falme. The second heron appears
                                after his fight with Ba'alzamon in Falme,
                                solidifying his identity as the Dragon Reborn.

                                "Daughter of the Night" is widely interpreted as
                                Lanfear, one of the Forsaken, who was deeply
                                connected to Lews Therin Telamon. The "ancient
                                war" refers to the ongoing conflict with the
                                Dark One. The "new lover" is most likely Rand,
                                with the cryptic phrase "serve her and die, yet
                                serve still" alluding to complex future
                                interactions and potential unintended
                                consequences of his actions that might benefit
                                her. "The Shining Walls shall kneel" is commonly
                                understood to refer to Tar Valon and the White
                                Tower, suggesting its eventual subjugation,
                                likely by the Seanchan.

                                make, including sacrificing those close to him.
                                It highlights the existential dilemma of his
                                path, offering a choice between a death that
                                transcends mortality and an eternal life, a
                                theme that resonates throughout the series.

                                Great Hunt*. "The seed of the Hammer" refers to
                                the descendants of Artur Hawkwing, which are the
                                Seanchan, and "burns the ancient tree" alludes

                                the Almoth Plain which had a tree emblem. The

                                debated, but could refer to the Aes Sedai from
                                the Shadow's perspective, or even the cleansing
                                of *saidin*.
